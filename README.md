# 📈 Stock Price Prediction App

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Stock Price Prediction Application developed with Python and Streamlit. The app is designed to forecast future stock prices for major tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Apple Inc. (AAPL). Leveraging an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, it offers interactive stock predictions and visualizations to assist with financial insights and decision-making.

## 🌟 Key Features
1. **15-Day Price Prediction**: Generate and view a 15-day forecast for selected stocks, providing insight into possible short-term price trends.
2. **Historical Data Visualization**: Display detailed historical data with high, low, open, and close prices, giving users a clear view of past stock performance.
3. **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app is easy to use and allows users to switch between different stocks and see forecasts instantly.
4. **LSTM-based Forecasting**: Utilize a deep learning model designed to handle time-series data, capturing the sequential patterns and dependencies in stock prices.
5. **Performance Metrics**: Include metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge the prediction accuracy and reliability.
